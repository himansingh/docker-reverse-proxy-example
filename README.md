# Reverse Proxy with Docker and nginx

This is an example repo of how to set up a reverse proxy using Docker, nginx, and multiple docker-compose.yml files. 

### Why?:  
* Never worry about which port a project/site is on, simply connect to port 80
* Connect related projects/sites easily without explicitly tying them together

### Reference: 
* [jwilder/reverse-proxy](https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy)
* [nginx](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx/)
* [docker-compose networking](https://docs.docker.com/compose/networking/)
